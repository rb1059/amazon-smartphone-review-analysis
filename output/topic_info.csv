could want except wifi but this phone is not considered a smartphone by at t so you do not have to pay the 30 data plan fee and you can use the 10 per month unlimited data i bought this phone for my husband because it seemed like the best alternative to an iphone and similar touchscreen smartphones without the issue of having to pay the ridiculous smartphone plan fee the camera works great even though it has no flash you just set it to night mode and can get a better picture in low light settings the internal data is plenty generous and you can also add an sd card for more memory my husband particularly likes this because it means he can use it just like an ipod or any other mp3 player and it also has the built in radio so he can listen to it while at work he is a residential commercial remodeler if he doesn't want to listen to his stored music you can still answer calls right from the earbuds while using the radio feature the touch screen is great the screen size is great it has fast response time from input or touch we have absolutely no complaints at all some people might not like the idea of not having wifi but if you think about it if you buy any similar phone you're going to have to pay the stupid 30 extra monthly fee even if you do not use at t internet with this phone you can just get the 10 unlimited data plan and be done with it the internet works great on this phone and is fast in our experience very happy with the purchase and the price is amazing call quality is great as with all nokias no issues whatsoever and highly recommended"", ""i use this for work and two phone numbers i have two sales jobs so each number is set for each company each number has its own line network bars showing for each line and text message will tell you what line you are using it will ask you what line you want to use before it seems or calls i was very impressed of the quality honestly as good with any top end cell the blu life view's cpu may not hit the highestst benchmark for gaming but it beats half of the other cells there are a lot of cell phones outthere so to beat half is darn good i have 4 emails set up and use the web browser a lot all at the same time and never really differ performance from all my other galaxy phones since this blu life view os is almost bare bone google android this might be the reason performance meets my needs i have a tmobile and straight talk sim in them data speeds have reached around 6 8 mbps so 3g to 4g speeds it is not lte band screen is nice crisp and bright no problem outdoors i will test the camera soon once you upload your apps that makes you you this an awesome phablet and phone i do recommend this 5 7 inch phablet for anything you really use a cell and tablet for plus about 400 less than the note 3 update it has been about a month with my blu life view and it is serving me well all functions just like my s4 but now with 2 phone lines 2 sims the size of the screen will make you feel why you didn't do this before your thoughts of the 5 7 screen after a few hours will take you back in memory remembering when you upgraded from a 3 inch iphone to a 4 5 inch samsung galaxy s2 your first impression wow this is a huge cell phone from my s2 and jumped to the s4 but when i hold my s4 after my blu the once before giant s4 screen seems real small basically you adjust and feels just right with this blu 5 7 screen it is more enjoyable viewing this large bright crisp screen easier working my emails and typing either landscape or portrait mode the lack of lte is not really a factor because lte areas are not consistent when driving around if your cell is lte look at it and notice it changing from 4g 3g hspa hspa lte when driving around the blu life view looks just like a note 3 and has not disappointed me one bit as stated in my first impression review i use this for work and all 4 emails owa web outlook gmail yahoo business aol and microsoft exchange email performed as they should the sound is not as loud as i want it especially when outdoors during a youth baseball game i use a wired ear buds and mic most of the time when taking with clients so not a big issue the bluetooth worked also with bluetooth earphones and mic it did have a hard time finding my bose speaker via bluetooth i have not experienced any lag or buggyness while switching apps and multi tasking battery can last all day and night but really depends on your habits the fm radio works and automatically find the local radio stations it will only work when you use the blu ear buds that came with it because it is the antenna mobile hot spot is fully functional too no need to root to turn your blu into its own wifi you can talk and use the browser use google maps all at the same time shows the 4 cpu very capable this saved me about 400 if i opt to buy the note 3 and that price wouldn't have 2 sim option and other unlocked gsm this is a great phablet with 2 sims smooth running os and unlocked with hot spot fully functional already"", ""this has to be one of the best kept secrets in smartphones the quality of this phone is top tier the fit and finish is very good and the quality of the materials makes this phone look like it should cost in the 600 800 range it is a big phone so if you want a smaller phone then get that but don't complain about the size of this one at 6 1 it is noticeably larger screen wise than the samsung note 3 4 but overall the phone isn't much bigger it's 2 gigs of system ram is more than plenty to run android the storage ram is expandable for no worries about having enough space to store pictures and so on just remember to set the storage preference to the external sd card the cpu is more than up to the task of running android and the apps you want even with an off line gps app running the camera running and email open and so on the phone never slowed down the os remained quick and responsive hauwei includes it's own interface but it isn't intrusive and actually works quite well 3rd party launchers can always change things if you want that big screen begs for windowing so hauwei includes wow or window on window still it is a phone not some 17 laptop running windows so even though the screen is large for a phone at 6 1 it is still 6 1 not 16 or 60 hauwei's os interface has the lollipop look to it like it or hate it the phone is running jellybean 4 3 and some people might be put off that it doesn't run kitkat ior lollipop oh well i haven't seen such a huge difference in the newer version numbers and in the real world neither will most people it can be easy to get all wrapped up in having the latest version of an os but unless the difference is really significant it makes little real life difference nevertheless hauwei has officially announced it will update the mate 2 to lollipop this year lest you forget when lollipop came out it had problems and according to some reports still does there is some benefit to not being the guinea pig there is nearly zero bloatware on this phone anything you don't want to run can either be disabled or prevented from using data or wifi depending on how you want to limit app access to connectivity the screen what a great display this phone has while it might not have the pixel density of premium phones it is a phone so you're really not going to notice much difference if any at all what you will notice is how much easier everything is to see and how much more of it will display the clarity is very good and the touch is accurate and responsive watching videos is so much easier on this phone than anything else size does matter and unless you go to a 7 tablet this is the largest you're going to get with good quality the case the case fits very good and the rear cover has that nice soft touch feel to it removing the rear cover reveals the embedded battery and two side by side slots one for the sim and the other for the sd memory card as with most phones the sim card is easier to put in than get out so use a piece of tape or a soft eraser to do that the bezel around the display is thin and that helps keep the phone size very manageable while the mate 2 is a large phone it can be handled quite easily by just about anyone except those with the smallest of hands you can put this phone in your back pocket and it isn't going to fall out barely thicker than the samsung note3 it is easy to hold the back case has a nice rounded profile to it so it fits the hand really well some phones are flat on the back and they are often difficult to hold even if they are smaller in size the rounded profile of the case back makes it fit the gap between your hand and the phone nicely and you get a secure grip sim and sd card slots the sim is a micro size some call it the nano size every service provider should be able to provide you with the proper sized sim now to the sd card slot the specs say the maximum is 32 gigs but i put in a 64 gig card it it works perfectly all you do if format the card and you have all that space i bet but can't say for sure that a 128 gig card would work too the battery the mate 2 has a monster battery it is easily 1 3 greater in capacity than phones close to this size even the nexus 6 has a smaller battery despite it being physically larger than the mate 2 this translates into longer use between charges for a comparison i fully charged my note3 and the mate2 and unplugged them at the same time i set the wifi on gps on and then went about using the mate2 for some web browsing downloading several larger apps and running chat sent voice via text took a few pictures and made 5 calls totaling over an hour at the end of the day 6pm the note 3 had 64 charge remaining despite not being used nearly as much while the mate 2 had 72 charge remaining had i used the note3 as much as the mate 2 the difference would be even more startling granted the note 3 has a removable battery but swapping batteries still means shutting it down and doing the swap with the mate 2 nothing required just use it knowing you have plenty of battery capacity on hand service availability i tried the mate 2 with a pre paid t mobile sim as well as a consumer cellular service and the mate 2 worked flawlessly download speeds in my area are above 20 megs down more than enough to do anything you need in both cases the sim setup the apn needed so it was a plug and play affair just make sure that if you use a post paid service that they register your imei properly or you experience delays but that has nothing to do with the mate 2 that is the service since consumer celluar uses at t towers service you are covered in the usa t mobile owns metro pcs so the bases are covered the mate 2 is an lte phone so you'll get all the speed you can from your service provider i did not try the mate 2 out on verizon but have no reason to believe it won't work on that network as well you have the ability to choose the type of service in the phone so verizon should work the mate 2 is unlocked i am very happy with the hauwei mate 2 the quality is right there with the brand names and the large screen and super battery make this phone unique as i said buying a large screen phone but needing or wanting something smaller means you should go buy that not the mate 2 if you want or need a large display a battery that has enough capacity to easily get you through 2 days or more depending on use the mate 2 is not going to disappoint you in fact people with other phones many costing more than 3 times as much might be envious when you look at a picture or browse the web""]"

windows phone going back to the original htc surround wow right i'm not going to get into the android os too much because it is what it is however i will say if windows gets snapchat i would go back in a second anyway the stock launcher which is what controls the home screen wasn't as great as it could be i downloaded hola launcher and have no other modifications as far as the os goes i feel this is a far as my review should go noting only that blu is not providing the latest update to android 5 0 lollipop however you can update it via hacks if you should so choose the build of this phone is amazing to put it lightly my friends say it looks fake because it is so thin and light plus the screen is wonderfully vibrant and bright in fact when i first got it out of the box i was afraid to hold it it is quite durable i have dropped it several times with no consequences but it was from low heights this phone is slippery those aforementioned low heights were from the phone slipping out of my pockets while i was crouching or sitting as i had said the screen is wonderful and is very crisp i can't tell a difference between my screen and that of the lg g3 except that mine is more colorful this is backed up by the fact that the 4k screen of the lg g3 far exceeds the visual capacity of the human eye so believe me a simple 1080p screen is good viewing it in sunlight isn't so great especially coming from the 920 which blows away all phones for daylight visibility however if you turn the brightness up all the way i can manage pretty well windows phones are known for their fluidity and this phone matches that i have experienced no issues ever i have the game implosion very fun btw and that runs like an xbox multitasking never bogs me down really this phone cannot be stopped speaking of stopping battery life is great too it's not fantastic but i can easily go all day without charging up compared to my 920 this is amazing but for others depending on what you're used to i'm not sure what you'll think this phone also charges very quickly i created a spreadsheet of my battery life for the first two weeks and it averages about 10 hrs of normal use the lowest it lasted was 6 hours after some intense gaming and 13 hours with very light use some other tidbits the camera is ok not great coming from a nokia but it has nice detail video at 1080p is pretty good but can get choppy audio recording is pretty nice front facing camera is very nice both are not great in low light and the flash often makes my photos very blue speakers aren't that loud i couldn't use it as an alarm clock call quality is good with cricket data speeds are slow but again my 920 was lte storage space is bad i'm really hurting here this is where design hurts function as i assume the svelte body restricts the bay for storage cards but i paid 200 for the phone so i'm not hung up on this overall i highly recommend this phone it has not let me down and it makes the switch to android from windows less painful i am very pleased with the phone and its included accessories update i dropped my phone hard right onto blacktop it didn't shatter just a little scuff on the corner i'm sure i just got lucky but wow"", 'i have had several lg cell phones and while i generally like lg they always have some bugs that well bug me the lg g4 meets my requirements for a new phone at a price i was willing to pay so i decided to give it a chance the phone is much bigger than my last lg but it is thinner and lighter the leather back is well executed but is not really my tastes so i replaced it with a plastic back it came with android 6 preinstalled and it is a huge improvement over my previous phone the screen is truly impressive it is quick to respond and so far has been stable mine is the us991 version and the manufacture date is after lg announced the fix for the boot loop error so hopefully that will not be an issue for a trial i put in an active straight talk sim card and it immediately picked up the network i did not try to make a call but i did have data tracfone was not so easy the byop sim would not activate and i eventually had to contact tracfone they suggested i use the gsm card but then i lost all of my minutes and data they did get it activated and it has worked perfectly ever since the specs are impressive and the phone does not disappoint the leather back may not work well with most protective cases they may fit but will be tight and difficult to remove i do suggest a good case the weather widget is not as attractive as my last phone but i am getting used to it on standby it lasts for days i disable wi fi and data when not in use and do not allow automatic updates which helps a lot in use the battery drains much faster of course the camera gets a lot of attention in my limited testing it is not as good as my dslr but it is better than any cell phone camera that i have ever had it is good in low light and has a panorama feature that is a lot of fun to play with and works well it also does video at full hd and 4k as much as i like this phone it is not perfect the keyboard is only marginally better than previousphones it often skips letters and the keyboard sometimes closes while i am typing i also had one instance when i put down the phone for about an hour and when i returned it was off at 72 charge i could find no reason for it to shut down but it has happened only once so far more recently i have had to restart the phone several times because data stopped working all in all i would recommend this phone', ""a month later update 6 20 2014 battery life is solid 3 days with my normal use i love that i am using magnetic cable to charge the phone no issues there i got two one for work and one for home so i would recommend it as accessory buy two instead of one docking station i have never tested if this phone is really water resistant or not kind of scary to test it annoying thing is the deleted photo thumbnail management as they stay on the phone even when you delete the picture you need to clear cache and restart the phone to get rid of unwanted thumbnails pictures calls are clear and i have lte with t mobile us in or and nv i would still recommend it to anyone who needs battery life and don't like big phones i am using this phone for 3 weeks and so far and it has frozen twice only it has recovered it self though why is this a positive when it froze i was really pressing opening closing apps and buttons and scrolling all over the place actually i was trying to overload it to see what will happen a k a hard core responsiveness test it held fine by normal use the phone don't freeze of course and is very very very responsive as responsive as any iphone i tested it i also have samsung tablet and if i would do the same test of responsiveness the tablet won't survive it and freeze until restarted this is my upgrade from nokia e6 too bad that nokia stopped the symbian development i was thinking to get an iphone since the price is about same but the battery life on iphones is poor this phone is a iphone killer i had the honor to test out win8 phone and let me tell you that it is useless and i was most happy when i returned it back to the shop i don't understand why the compact version of z1 is not on sale officially in us in tmobile or att etc this could be a cash cow one of my priorities was the battery life with my normal usage the phone last for 2 days and on stamina mode even 2 75 up to 3 days if i stretch it which is close to what my old nokia e6 was capable of it says that the phone can be in stand by mode for a week never had the time to test it but i will one day second was the phone display size just perfect i don't like the big phones third open to all gsm 3g 4g frequencies global phone i am in or on tmobil network and lte 4g 3g works fine on this phonefourth fm radio and free offline world wide navigation overall the phone is a solid build as described in other review i put screen protector and cover from the day one just buy it together to have the phone look new longer i read that the display and phone back can be scratched easily so i just prevented it from occurring i am not app fanatic so don't have too many all kinds of apps on it but i am using skype free offline navigation most time and for general web surfing i prefer to use mobile web page for yahoo facebook rather than an app for it i don't mind the extra log in password the fm radio is nice feature that i am using daily instead of interned radio saves battery life and data too i also have avast anti virus free edition and think about to upgrade to premium 15 a year camera is definitely an upgrade from what i had but if we need to take nice good quality pics we use the dslr camera and not a phone but it is nice to have that handy it says it has 21mpx but it can't compare with the dslr of course i also use this phone at work to sync my 2007 outlook calendar with the phone calendar need those upcoming meeting reminders especially in meeting back to back i am using the exchange account setting sync over company wifi to do that which is fine i know that there are apps out there that can do that too wireless i will post an update in few months i definitely recommend this phone over iphone or any other 4in isch smart phone""]"
